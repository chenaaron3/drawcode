 operator. The modulo operator is indicated by % and gives the remainder of a division calculation. If the two numbers are divisible, then the result of the modulo operation will be 0.

# Prints 4 because 29 / 5 is 5 with a remainder of 4
print(29 % 5)
 
# Prints 2 because 32 / 3 is 10 with a remainder of 2
print(32 % 3)
 
# Modulo by 2 returns 0 for even numbers and 1 for odd numbers
# Prints 0
print(44 % 2)

Here, we use the modulo operator to find the remainder of division operations. We see that 29 % 5 equals 4, 32 % 3 equals 2, and 44 % 2 equals 0.

Let’s look at another example to get a better idea of how modulo is useful in programming:

print(3 % 3) # Prints 0
print(4 % 3) # Prints 1
print(5 % 3) # Prints 2
print(6 % 3) # Prints 0
print(7 % 3) # Prints 1

In each of these modulo operations, 3 is the divisor. Since 3 / 3 equals 1 with no remainder, the result of the first modulo operation is 0. Note that as the dividend increases by 1, the remainder also increases by 1, until we reach the next number that is evenly divisible by 3 — this creates a pattern that repeats contiuously as the dividend increases by 1!

Because of this, the modulo operator is useful in programming when we want to perform an action every nth time something occurs. Imagine you own a small café and would like for every 7th customer to receive a survey. If every customer transaction is numbered in the order they occur, you can determine which customers should receive the survey by calculating transaction_number % 7 — if the result is 0, hand out the survey!

# Task 1
.
You are starting a new campaign for your online shop where every 10th customer gets 10% off their next order. To easily calculate this, you decide that order numbers divisible by 10 will receive the coupon.

Here comes the first order of the day, #269!

Create a new variable, first_order_remainder and set it equal to 269 modulo 10.

Then, print out first_order_remainder to find out if that customer will receive a discount.

# Task 2
Look at the printed value of first_order_remainder. Was the remainder 0, meaning that the customer should receive a coupon for this order?

Create a new variable called first_order_coupon and assign to it a value of "yes" if the order should get a coupon. Otherwise, give first_order_coupon the value of "no".

# Task 3
Here comes the second order of the day, #270! Let’s see if they will get a discount!

Find the remainder by calculating 270 modulo 10 and store the result in a new variable named second_order_remainder.

Then, print out second_order_remainder.

# Task 4
Based on the printed value of second_order_remainder, should the customer receive a coupon for this order?

Create a new variable named second_order_coupon and give it a value of "yes" if the order should get a coupon. Otherwise, give second_order_coupon the value of "no".

# Template
N/A

# Solution
first_order_remainder = 269 % 10
print(first_order_remainder)

first_order_coupon = "no"

second_order_remainder = 270 % 10
print(second_order_remainder)

second_order_coupon = "yes"
