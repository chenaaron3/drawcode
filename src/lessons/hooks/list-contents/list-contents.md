# List Contents

Lists can contain more than just numbers. Let’s revisit our classroom example with heights:

- Noelle is 61 inches tall
- Ava is 70 inches tall
- Sam is 67 inches tall
- Mia is 64 inches tall

Instead of storing each student’s height, we can make a list that contains their names:

```python
names = ["Noelle", "Ava", "Sam", "Mia"]
```

We can even combine multiple data types in one list. For example, this list contains both a string and an integer:

```python
mixed_list_string_number = ["Noelle", 61]
```

Lists can contain any data type in Python! For example, this list contains a string, integer, boolean, and float.

```python
mixed_list_common = ["Mia", 27, False, 0.5]
```

Let’s experiment with different data types in our own lists!
