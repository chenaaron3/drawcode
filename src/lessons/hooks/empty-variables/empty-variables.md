# Empty Variables

In Python, the special value `None` represents the absence of a value. Think of it as an empty treasure chest â€“ it exists, but it holds no items yet. For instance:

```python
empty_chest = None
```

In a gaming context, you might use `None` to signal that a character's attribute, like their score or name, has yet to be defined. For example:

```python
score = None  # The score of the character is not yet calculated
name = None   # The character's name has not been entered yet
```

This approach is useful when you want to check if a value has been set before proceeding with further actions in the game.
