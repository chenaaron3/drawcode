# Boolean Operators: or

The boolean operator `or` combines two expressions into a larger expression that is `True` if either component is `True`.

Consider the statement

"Oranges are a fruit or apples are a vegetable."

This statement is composed of two expressions: "oranges are a fruit" which is `True` and "apples are a vegetable" which is `False`. Because the two expressions are connected by the `or` operator, the entire statement is `True`. Only one component needs to be `True` for an `or` statement to be `True`.

In English, `or` implies that if one component is `True`, then the other component must be `False`. This is not true in Python. If an `or` statement has two `True` components, it is also `True`.

Letâ€™s take a look at a couple of examples in Python:

```python
True or (3 + 4 == 7)    # True
(1 - 1 == 0) or False   # True
(2 < 0) or True         # True
(3 == 8) or (3 > 4)     # False
```

Notice that each `or` statement that has at least one `True` component is `True`, but the final statement has two `False` components, so it is `False`.
