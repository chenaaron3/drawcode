# Boolean Operators: and

Often, the conditions you want to check in your conditional statement will require more than one boolean expression to cover. In these cases, you can build larger boolean expressions using boolean operators. These operators (also known as logical operators) combine smaller boolean expressions into larger boolean expressions.

There are three boolean operators that we will cover:

- `and`
- `or`
- `not`

Letâ€™s start with `and`.

`and` combines two boolean expressions and evaluates as `True` if both its components are `True`, but `False` otherwise.

Consider the example:

> Oranges are a fruit and carrots are a vegetable.

This boolean expression is comprised of two smaller expressions, "oranges are a fruit" and "carrots are a vegetable," both of which are `True` and connected by the boolean operator `and`, so the entire expression is `True`.

Letâ€™s look at an example of some `and` statements in Python:

```python
(1 + 1 == 2) and (2 + 2 == 4)   # True

(1 > 9) and (5 != 6)            # False

(1 + 1 == 2) and (2 < 1)        # False

(0 == 10) and (1 + 1 == 1)      # False
```

Notice that in the second and third examples, even though part of the expression is `True`, the entire expression as a whole is `False` because the other statement is `False`. The fourth statement is also `False` because both components are `False`.
