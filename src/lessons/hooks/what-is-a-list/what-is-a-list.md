# What is a List?

In programming, it is common to want to work with collections of data. In Python, a **list** is one of the many built-in data structures that allows us to work with a collection of data in sequential order.

Suppose we want to make a list of the heights of students in a class:

- Noelle is 61 inches tall
- Ava is 70 inches tall
- Sam is 67 inches tall
- Mia is 64 inches tall

In Python, we can create a variable called `heights` to store these integers into a list:

```python
heights = [61, 70, 67, 64]
```

Notice that:

- A list begins and ends with square brackets (`[` and `]`).
- Each item (i.e., `67` or `70`) is separated by a comma (`,`).
- Itâ€™s considered good practice to insert a space (` `) after each comma, but your code will run just fine if you forget the space.

Let's write our own list!
