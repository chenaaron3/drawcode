# Boolean Expressions

To build control flow in our program, we need to be able to check whether a condition is true or not. For this, we use Boolean expressions.

A **Boolean expression** is a statement that can either be true or false. The statement must be answered by true or false only, and it must be verifiable with evidence. It cannot rely on interpretation or opinion.

To understand this, let’s go back to the ‘waking up’ example. The first question, “Is today a weekday?” can be written as a Boolean expression shown below:

Today is a weekday.

This expression can be true - if today is Tuesday, for example - or false if it’s a weekend. There are no other options, we know the answer is verifiable, and it does not rely on an opinion.

Now, consider the following phrase:

Friday is the best day of the week.

Is this a Boolean expression?

No, this statement is an opinion and is subjective. Someone might say that “Wednesday is the best day.” and their statement would be no less true or false than the one above.

How about the following phrase:

Sunday starts with the letter 'C.'

Yes, this is a Boolean expression since the answer can only be true or false and it is verifiable. Even though the statement itself is false (Sunday starts with the letter ‘S’ and not ‘C’), it is still a Boolean expression.
