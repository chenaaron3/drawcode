# Strings

Programmers use the term **strings** to describe blocks of text data. In our first lesson, we created the string "Hello World!".

In Python, a string can be enclosed in either double quotes (`"Welcome to PythonQuest"`) or single quotes (`'Welcome to PythonQuest'`). The choice between single and double quotes doesn't affect functionality, but it's important to maintain consistency throughout your code.

Here are examples of both approaches:

```python
character_class = "Warrior"
quest_name = 'The Ancient Temple'
```

Both variables contain valid strings. Pick one quotation style and stick with it for cleaner, more readable code.
