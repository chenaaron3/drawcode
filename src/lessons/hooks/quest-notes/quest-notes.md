# Comments

In Python, we use special markers called **comments** to write notes that help us remember what our code does, without affecting how our program runs.

Python treats anything after a `#` symbol as a comment - it's like writing in invisible ink that only programmers can see!

Comments can:

- Explain why you wrote something a certain way:

```python
# This variable tracks how many treasure chests we've found
treasure_count = 0
```

- Help others understand your code quickly:

```python
# This spell calculates the chance of finding a rare gem
calculate_gem_discovery_probability()
```

- Temporarily disable a line of code to test different approaches:

```python
# old_magic_spell = cast_fireball()
new_magic_spell = cast_lightning_bolt()
```
