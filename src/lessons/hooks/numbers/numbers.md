# Numbers

**Variables** are containers that store data values. They allow you to store, manipulate, and retrieve information throughout your program.

Think of a variable as a labeled storage box in memory that you can access by using its name. Each variable has a unique **name** and a **value** that can be different data types. Python automatically determines the variable type, making development more streamlined.

To create a variable, use this **format**:

```python
variable_name = value
```

Let's explore the different types of numbers:

- `int` - whole numbers, such as `42` or `-15`
- `float` - decimal numbers, such as `3.14` or `0.75`

### Examples

To create an `int` variable named `health` with the value `100`:

```python
health = 100
```

To create a `float` variable named `damage` with the value `25.5`:

```python
damage = 25.5
```
